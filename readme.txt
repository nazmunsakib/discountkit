* **Product Adjustment**: Apply discounts directly to individual product prices
* **Cart Adjustment**: Apply discounts to the entire cart total
* **Bulk Discount**: Create quantity-based pricing tiers with different discount levels

= Discount Types =

Within each rule type, you can choose how the discount is calculated:

* **Percentage**: Reduce price by a percentage (e.g., 20% off)
* **Fixed Amount**: Subtract a fixed amount from the price
* **Fixed Price**: Set a specific price for bulk discount tiers

= Product Selection =

* Include or exclude specific products
* Include or exclude entire categories
* Combine multiple filters for precise targeting

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/discount-kit` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.

3. Ensure WooCommerce is installed and activated.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin require WooCommerce? =

Yes, WooCommerce must be installed and activated for this plugin to function.

= Can I create multiple discount rules? =

Yes, you can create unlimited discount rules and set priorities to control which rule applies when multiple rules match.

= What is the difference between Rule Type and Discount Type? =

Rule Type determines where the discount applies:
– Product Adjustment: Modifies individual product prices
– Cart Adjustment: Applies to the entire cart subtotal
– Bulk Discount: Creates tiered pricing based on quantity

Discount Type determines how the discount is calculated:
– Percentage: Calculates discount as a percentage of the price
– Fixed Amount: Subtracts a specific amount from the price
– Fixed Price: Sets an exact price (available for bulk discounts)

= How do bulk discounts work? =

Bulk discounts allow you to set different prices based on quantity ranges. For example, 1-5 items at one price, 6-10 items at a lower price, and so on. You can choose between individual product quantity or cumulative quantity across all matching products.

= Can I exclude specific products from discounts? =

Yes, you can use the exclude option in product filters to prevent discounts from applying to specific products or categories.

= What happens if multiple rules apply to the same product? =

The plugin uses rule priority to determine which discount applies. Rules with lower priority numbers are evaluated first.
