### Hooks & Filters

// Modify discount calculation
add_filter('discountkit_calculate_discount', function($discount, $rule, $product) {
    // Custom logic
    return $discount;
}, 10, 3);

// Modify product discount price
add_filter('discountkit_product_discount_price', function($price, $product_id) {

// After discount calculation
add_action('discountkit_discount_calculated', function($discount_amount, $cart) {
    // Custom logic
}, 10, 2);
```

### REST API

Access discount rules programmatically:

```
GET /wp-json/discountkit/v1/rules
GET /wp-json/discountkit/v1/rules/{id}
POST /wp-json/discountkit/v1/rules
PUT /wp-json/discountkit/v1/rules/{id}
DELETE /wp-json/discountkit/v1/rules/{id}
```

### Database Schema

The plugin creates two custom tables:

- `wp_discountkit_rules` - Stores discount rules
- `wp_discountkit_settings` - Stores plugin settings

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Discounts Not Applying

1. Check rule status is **Active**
2. Verify product matches rule filters
3. Check date range if configured
4. Verify usage limit not reached
5. Check rule priority order

### Conflicts with Other Plugins

1. Check **Coupon Behavior** setting
2. Disable third-party discount plugins temporarily
3. Clear WooCommerce cache
4. Check for theme conflicts

### Performance Issues

1. Limit number of active rules
2. Use specific product/category filters instead of "All Products"
3. Enable WordPress object caching
4. Optimize database tables
